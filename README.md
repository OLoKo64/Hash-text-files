# Hash-text-files
 This script generates hashes from every line of a text file.
 
 # How to use
 You have to edit the parameters in the file to match what you want, I left it configured for the text.txt file already there, as an example.

 Remember to edit the encoding, since each file can be different. For example, the most common ones are "utf-8" and "ansi". Check before using.

 The text file left there serves as an example of what the formatting should be for the script to work

 To run it just execute in the CMD or in the Terminal with Python3.6+.
